# netflix-clone

Made this front end clone to demonstrate my front-end skills with future employers. I believe I can do all of the functionality netflix does, but I don't have the database for it. I think it would take too much time researching all of the shows and movies information to make that worth it. Instead of manipulating a database to get the proper movies on the web app I decided to use a TMDB API to demonstrate knowledge of how to handle API's properly.
